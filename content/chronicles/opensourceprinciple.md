When working in any team that needs to take decisions, you want to take the best decision possible to make your team go forward the best way possible.

Open source communities are well known for being awesome at working asynchronously, innovativly, having debates and multiple conversations minimizing real time talk, meetings and chat.

Why not borrow some practices from opensource communities and bring those to your internal company community.

## Introducing changes through asynchronous decisions

Rust has this awesome RFCs (request for comments) process, where everyone inside and outside of Rust, can come up with ideas and comment on existing ideas. In the end, this brings a better more awesome rust programming language. And the trust in decisions is greater since everyone could bring their expertise on.

Why not apply this RFC process internally in your company or product team. I made this experiment recently at [Pleo](https://pleo.io) and it turned out giving us great results.

## Template for change introduction

The template for Rust was minimally adapted.


```markdown

```

Productive technical discussions

developers are usually somewhat introverts with big opinions (at least that's I feel I am)

Thanks to the Rust programming language [RFC](https://github.com/rust/rfcs) process.
