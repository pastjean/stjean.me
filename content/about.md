title: About p-a!

Kitesurfer and avid food eater living in Quebec city. 

It's cold outa here, but there are some awesome landscape to wonder at, mountains
to conquer, and seafearers to hear stories from to. I am also known as a 
practician of a foreign art, which consists of looking at a screen filled with 
small coloured letters on a dark screen.

You can find me hitting the waves or, on [Twitter][] and [GitHub][].

I am currently doing awesome things as a Senior software developer at [Pleo.io][].

I was previously at [Coveo][] where I did a lot of things like software engineering, deploying kubernetes, some [go][] and java, microservices architecture and good beer propaganda.

I studied software engineering at [ETS][] and helped awesome guys build the
[Chinook][], a wind turbine vehicle. I also worked as a research assistant in
computational systems biology. Although, biology is still something I hardly
understand.

I grew up in [Sept-ÃŽles, Qc][7i-map], a far and foreign place, but it's a place
everyone should go and explore. A place with enough beach and wind for you
to kitesurf for a century, never touching the same sand twice. Be warned though,
it's cold, you'll need a hard skin or an oddly wired brain to go in there unprepared.
