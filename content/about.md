My name's Pierre-Alexandre, a kitesurfer and avid food eater living
in Quebec city. It's cold outa here but there is some awesome landscape
to wonder at, mountains to conquer and seafearers to listen to.
I am also know as a practician of a foreign art, which consists of drawing
small letters on a dark screen also known as software engineering.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pastjean),
[GitHub](https://github.com/pastjean) and hitting the waves.

I work as at [Coveo](http://coveo.com) where I do software engineering,
some [go](https://golang.org) and good beer propaganda. The team over there is
quite awesome.

I studied sofware engineering at [ETS](https://etsmtl.ca) and helped awesome guys
build the [Chinook](http://www.chinookets.com/), a wind turbine vehicule. I also
worked as a research assistant in computational systems biology. Tough, biology is still
something I hardly understand.

I grew up in [Sept-ÃŽles, Qc](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sept-Iles,+QC,+Canada/@50.2874211,-66.6806364,9z),
 yeah, that's far, but it's a place everyone should go and explore. There is enough beach and wind for me
 to kitesurf for a century, never touching the same sand twice.
