Software engineer, currently living in Québec city, enjoying outdoors, hiking, touring skiing and kitesurfing. I love to make pasta and pizza dough from scratch and try to some other weird fermentations of food.

You can find me hitting the waves, the mountains or, on [Twitter] and [GitHub]. In the downtimes you can find me cooking, brewing beer, reading and talking about software engineering culture, distributed systems, programming languagues, remote work culture, organizing work, autonomous and distributed teams...

I grew up in [Sept-Îles, Qc], entryway to the lower north shore of the Québec province. A place with enough beaches and wind for you
to kitesurf for a century, never touching the same sand twice. You've been warned though, it's cold, you'll need a hard skin or an oddly wired brain to go in there unprepared.

I currently am doing software engineering, infrastructure on a zero-knowledge messaging platform for healthcare named [Braver]. In the past, I have been a tech lead and engineering manager at [1Password] building the identity integration with a small team that would integrate in customers infrastructure. I also was part of [Pleo.io] from the early days, building a 
expense management solution, doing fraud detection, infrastructure, from being software engineer, tech lead and engineering manager.

I also was at [Coveo] where I did a lot of things like software engineering, deploying kubernetes, advocating go, building some java microservices architecture. I did study software engineering at [ETS] and helped awesome guys build the [Chinook], a wind turbine vehicle. Aftwerwards, I worked as a research assistant in computational systems biology. Although, biology is still something I hardly understand.
