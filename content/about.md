title: About p-a!
---

Kitesurfer and avid food eater living in Quebec city. 

It's cold outa here but there is some awesome landscape to wonder at, mountains
to conquer and seafearers to hear stories from to. I am also know as a 
practician of a foreign art, which consists of looking at a screen fill with 
small coloured letters on a dark screen.

You can find me on [Twitter][], [GitHub][] and hitting the waves.

I work as at [Coveo][] where I do software engineering,
some [go][], microservices and good beer propaganda. The team
 over there is awesome, you should check us out.

I studied sofware engineering at [ETS][] and helped awesome guys build the 
[Chinook][], a wind turbine vehicule. I also worked as a research assistant in
computational systems biology. Tough, biology is still something I hardly
understand.

I grew up in [Sept-ÃŽles, Qc][7i-map], a far foreign place, but it's a place
everyone should go and explore. A place with enough beach and wind for me
to kitesurf for a century, never touching the same sand twice. I warn you out
though, it's cold, you'll need a hard skin or an oddly wired brain to go in 
there unprepared.
